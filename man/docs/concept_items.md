Onix is all about managing configuration information reactively. 

*Configuration* as in the relative arrangement of parts or elements in an environment.
*Reactive* as in observing and responding to stimuli from such environment for the purpose of proactive management.

Anything in the world we observe can be recorded in one way or another. 
For example, a photograph is a point in time, visual representation of an arrangement of elements that appear in the picture. 

Any arrangement of elements could be thought of following a pattern that describes the form the arrangement takes. 
Such patterns are also called models. 

Conversely, models can be used to shape the form an arrangement should take. 

In Onix, a part or element in an arrangement is called item (a.k.a. configuration item or CI). The arrangement itself, 
it is represented by a combination of items and the links between them. This arrangement of items forms a 
[graph structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)).

The Onix logotype is a depiction of a graph structure as shown below:

Arrangements of items and links in Onix follow a model. Models are fundamental to validate arrangements of linked items
in Onix and are explained later.

Going back to the photograph example, the elements in the picture could be a family. A family follows a model:
- A family has a father
- A family has a mother
- A family has one or more children
- The family members are sitting on a sofa
