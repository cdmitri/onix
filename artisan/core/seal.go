	// the cryptographic signature for:
	// - package & seal authentication:
	//     When the verifier validates the digital signature using public key of the package author, he is assured that signature has been created only by author who possess the corresponding secret private key and no one else.
	// - package & seal data integrity:
	//     In case an attacker has access to the package & seal and modifies them, the digital signature verification at receiver end fails.
	//     The hash of modified package and seal and the output provided by the verification algorithm will not match. Hence, receiver can safely deny the package & seal content assuming that data integrity has been breached.
	//     The seal is broken.
	// - non-repudiation:
	//     Since it is assumed that only the author (signer) has the knowledge of the signature key, they can only create unique signature on a given package.
	//     Thus the receiver can present the package and the digital signature to a third party as evidence if any dispute arises in the future.
