# Onix 

Onix is a lightweight configuration management database (CMDB) accessible via a [RESTful Web API](./docs/wapi.md), that 
provides:
 
 - Customisation, via [Models](./models/readme.md), and 
 - Integration with automation technology, via [Connectors](./connectors/readme.md)  

Automatic synchronisation from various data sources, via Feeders is planned for the near future.

The following sections explain the solution in more detail:

- [Architecture](./docs/architecture.md)
- [Installing Onix CMDB](./docs/installation.md)
- [CMDB Model](./docs/model.md)
- [Web API](./docs/wapi.md)
- [Connectors](./connectors/readme.md)
