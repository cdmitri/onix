# Onix Web Console

The default web user interface client for the Onix Web API.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

The following are useful links to come up to speed with the key technologies used by the Web Console:

### TypeScript

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a typed programming language to build modern web applications. It is a superset of [JavaScript](https://javascript.info/) that compiles to plain JavaScript.

The Web Console is built using TypeScript. More information about the language can be found [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html).

### PatternFly

[PatternFly](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/) is an open source design system aiming to improve the consistency, look and feel, and usability of web user interfaces.

The Web Console uses Patternfly ReactJS components to render its user interface. More information on how to use PatternFly can be found [here](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/documentation/react/overview/training).

### React JS

[React JS](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library to build web user interfaces.

The Web Console uses React JS (in conjunction with PatternFly)to build encapsulated components that manage their own state, and can be composed  to make complex UIs.

A tutorial can be taken [here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

You can learn more in the [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) documentation section.

### Redux JS

[Redux JS](https://redux.js.org/) is a library to manage state of JavaScript applications.

The Web Console uses Reduc JS and [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) to manage user interface state.

To get started with Redux see [here](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started#just-the-basics).

### Yarn

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is a package manager for JavaScript.

In Yarn, code is shared through something called a package. A package contains all the code being shared as well as a package.json file (called a manifest) which describes the package.

The Web Console uses Yarn to develop, test and build the user interface.
